Macmillan's government had been increasingly unpopular in the mid-term, and Douglas-Home faced a difficult task in rebuilding the party's popularity. Wilson had begun to try to tie the Labour Party to the growing confidence of Britain in the 1960s, asserting that the ""white heat of [the] revolution"" would sweep away ""restrictive practices... on both sides of industry"". This helped him secure victory with a small overall majority of five.[1] In addition, the resurgence of the Liberal Party, which doubled its share of the vote in this election, arguably contributed to the scale of the Conservative defeat as well as to the modest gains of the Labour party."	http://www.higher-thoughts.co.uk/p2015/1pixel.png		"<iframe src='http://www.higher-thoughts.co.uk/p2015/column3D.html?eventId=1964' width='800px' height='400px' frameborder='0' scrolling=""""no"""" overflow=""""hidden"""" overlay='hidden'></iframe>"	141		da

Wilson's decision to call an election turned on the fact that his government, elected a mere 17 months previously in 1964 had an unworkably small majority of only 4 MPs. Wilson's hope that he would be returned to office with a larger majority had been encouraged by the government's victory in a by-election in Kingston upon Hull North. In the end the hope was vindicated: the Labour government was returned with a much larger majority of 96.[1]"	http://www.higher-thoughts.co.uk/p2015/1pixel.png		"<iframe src='http://www.higher-thoughts.co.uk/p2015/column3D.html?eventId=1966' width='800px' height='400px' frameborder='0' scrolling=""""no"""" overflow=""""hidden"""" overlay='hidden'></iframe>"	142		da
